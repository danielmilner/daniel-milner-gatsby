## About Me

First and foremost, I'm a husband and a father. By day, I'm an Information Technology Specialist at __[Scientific Cutting Tools, Inc.](https://sct-usa.com/)__ By night, I'm the lead developer at __[FireTree Design](https://firetreedesign.com/)__. I've been working in the IT field for over 20 years and love to create and develop new things.

## Web Development

I've been a web developer for well over 10 years now. One of the first sites that I helped develop was a software download site called RadFiles. Since then, I've created a wish list site and a prayer journal site, both of which are no longer active. My day job has also led to the creation of several Intranet sites for various tasks. In 2012, I started developing custom themes and plugins for WordPress. I still have much to learn, but am enjoying the journey.

Most recently, I've taken up React and begun to hone my JavaScript skills.

## Software Development

I wrote my first piece of publicly available software immediately after Windows XP was released to retail. (Approximately September of 2001) At that point, I was highly into tweaking/customizing Windows and wrote what is to my knowledge the first program that was available to modify and manage Windows XP logon screens. The program was called **Logon Loader** and had been downloaded over 1 million times. Although I have no maintained Logon Loader for several years, you can still find it on a number of download sites.

The second piece of software that I created was called **Net Profiles**. As you may have guessed from the name, it allows you to create network profiles that can be loaded on demand. Useful for moving a windows laptop from home/work/school/etc without having to manually change network settings, mapped drive, and default printers. In May of 2009, I released Net Profiles as open source software and ceased active development approximately 2 years later. Luckily, the project has been picked up by some new developers and is currently in active development as __[Net Profiles mod](https://github.com/netprofilesmod/netprofilesmod)__.

At my day job, I continue to write Windows software. the most recent and robust project being a custom quote management system for creating and archiving wuotes for customers. The project integrates wiht our accounting system for security and authentication as well as product and customer information.
