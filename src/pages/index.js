    <H2>Web Development</H2>

      I've been a web developer for well over 10 years now. One of the first
      sites that I helped develop was a software download site called RadFiles.
      Since then, I've created a wish list site and a prayer journal site, both
      of which are no longer active. My day job has also led to the creation of
      severl Intranet sites for various tasks. In 2012, I started developing
      custom themes and plugins for WordPress. I still have much to learn, but
      am enjoying the journey.

      I wrote my first piece of publicly available software immediately after
      Windows XP was released to retail. (Approximately September of 2001) At
      that point, I was highly into tweaking/customizing Windows and wrote what
      is to my knowledge the first program that was available to modify and
      manage Windows XP logon screens. The program was called{' '}
      <strong>Logon Loader</strong> and had been downloaded over 1 million
      times. Although I have no maintained Logon Loader for several years, you
      can still find it on a number of download sites.

      The second piece of software that I created was called{' '}
      <strong>Net Profiles</strong>. As you may have guessed from the name, it
      allows you to create network profiles that can be loaded on demand. Useful
      for moving a windows laptop from home/work/school/etc without having to
      manually change network settings, mapped drive, and default printers. In
      May of 2009, I released Net Profiles as open source software and ceased
      active development approximately 2 years later. Luckily, the project has
      been picked up by some new developers and is currently in active
      development as{' '}

      robust project being a custom quote management system for creating and
      archiving wuotes for customers. The project integrates wiht our accounting
